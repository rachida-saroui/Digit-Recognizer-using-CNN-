# Digit-Recognizer-using-CNN-

The goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. 
I used CNN for this task and got Score: 0.99342

I also used PCA(Principal Component Analysis) as part of preprocessing to reduce the number of dimensions in the training datase and de-noise the data because PCA is computed by finding the components which explain the greatest amount of variance, it captures the signal in the data and omits the noise.
